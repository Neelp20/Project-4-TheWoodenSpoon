### Site-Goals

The site is aimed to help restaurant staff to easily manage the menus displayed on the website, as well as keeping track of upcoming bookings and capacity, editing and deleting as neccessary. 

The site also aims to provide customers with a simple, hassle free way to make reservations online or by calling the restaurant. They will also be able to cancel their bookings or update when needed.

### Agile Planning

This project was developed using agile methodologies by delivering small features in incremental sprints. spaced out evenly over four weeks.

All projects were assigned to epics, prioritized under the labels, Must have, should have, could have."Must have" stories were completed first, "should haves" and then finally "could haves". It was done this way to ensure that all core requirements were completed first to give the project a complete feel, with the nice to have features being added should there be capacity.

The Kanban board was created using github projects and can be located [here](https://github.com/users/Neelp20/projects/17/views/1) and can be viewed to see more information on the project cards. All stories except the documentation tasks have a full set of acceptance criteria in order to define the functionality that marks that story as complete.
